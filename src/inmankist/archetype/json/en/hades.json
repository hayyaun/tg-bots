  "Sometimes I'm so absorbed in my own world that the difference between illusion and reality is hard for me - what I see vs what's really happening outside - because sometimes thoughts and fantasies and illusory images of the inner world seem more real and true than the outer world",
  "I'm a solitary and introverted person and feel more secure and comfortable in solitude than in gatherings, and the world of external connections is incomprehensible to me",
  "To be accepted in gatherings I try to be someone other than myself, and at the same time most of the time I'm with others, I'm absorbed in my inner world",

  "My introversion causes me not to have a good relationship with my children and they generally see me as sullen",
  "Others see me as sullen and lacking humor",
  "Death doesn't scare me because it's a manifestation of the beauty of creation and life that is captured in a moment and can be imagined. For me it brings liberation and freedom and takes the heaviness of this body from me and connects me to what I truly am"
